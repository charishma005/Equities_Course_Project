# Industry Analyst Revisions vs. Industry Momentum

MFE 230G Active Asset Management, final project. Long-short strategy across the
49 Fama-French industries that blends industry price momentum with I/B/E/S
analyst EPS revisions. The full working plan, thesis, and rejection criterion
are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Setup

Python 3.9 or newer (tested on 3.9 and 3.11).

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

WRDS credentials are never stored in the repo. On first run the `wrds` package
prompts for your password and offers to create `~/.pgpass`. Optionally set
`WRDS_USERNAME` to skip the username prompt.

## Run end to end

| Phase | Command | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Data pulls (WRDS) | `python -m src.pull_wrds` | `data/raw/*.parquet` (not in git) |
| 1. ...or import web-query downloads | `python -m src.import_wrds_files ~/Downloads/<file> ...` | same files as above |
| 1. Data pulls (public) | `python -m src.pull_public` | `data/raw/kf_*.parquet`, `fred_macro.parquet` |
| 2. Clean and link | `python -m src.clean` | `data/interim/*.parquet`, coverage tables |
| 3. Build signals | `python -m src.signals` | `data/processed/signals.parquet`, signal summary |
| 4–8. IC, risk, portfolio, attribution, robustness | not yet implemented | |

Tests: `python -m pytest -q tests`

Pull scripts skip files that already exist; pass `--force` to re-pull.

interpretation caveats, see
[`docs/data_collection_and_interpretation.md`](docs/data_collection_and_interpretation.md).

## Conventions

- Monthly dates are **month-end timestamps** (last calendar day, `datetime64`),
  set by `src/utils.to_month_end` at load time.
- Returns are decimals; Ken French percent returns are divided by 100 on load,
  and `-99.99` / `-999` become NaN.
- All parameters are in `config.py`.
- `data/raw/` and `data/interim/` are git-ignored (licensed WRDS data).

## Status notes

### Phase 1: data pulls (refreshed 2026-10-03)

- WRDS pulls use the current CRSP CIZ monthly and names tables, I/B/E/S statsum,
  and the I/B/E/S-CRSP link history. CRSP total returns are not adjusted a second
  time with legacy delisting returns.
- Public sources were refreshed from Ken French and FRED. FRED's October 2026
  monthly average is partial because only early-October observations were
  available at pull time.
- WRDS currently serves CRSP monthly observations only through December 2025;
  I/B/E/S statsum runs through August 2026. The link history yields no linked
  ticker-months in 2026, so the cleaned I/B/E/S-CRSP panel ends in December 2025.

CRSP ends 8 months before I/B/E/S statpers. The source did not provide data
through October 2026; do not interpret carried CRSP characteristics as current
prices. The linked panel includes `crsp_date`, `price_age_months`, and a blank
`prc` whenever the attached CRSP observation is carried forward.
